</a><br>This is the final installment of the WHEN RIVALS PLAY series by BB reid and is the story of vaughn and tyra. Those who read The punk and plaything know what actually happened between tyra and vaughn that made them drift apart. However if you have not read the remaining novels of the seires then I suggest you better do so because the plots are linked all together. <br><br><i>"God , I hated him.<br>I might have even loved him. <br>Only time would tell."</i><br><br>So the novel starts with the scene of vaughn cheating on tyra and her catching him in the act. Tyra then runs away and Vaughn starts working with his father. There is also the entry of new characters which you will meet when you read the book, and let me warn you one of those new characters is a real bitch and your hands will itch to wring her neck.<br><a href="https://imgur.com/WCBgHFK" rel="nofollow">

</a><br>Then the story if fast forwarded to a few months and Vaughn and Tyra meet again. That's when Vaughn comes to know that tyra was pregnant and basically kidnaps and bring her to his home. <br>From that point of the story there are a lot of fuckups , fights, cute baby moments and soooo much erotic scenes.<br>My favourite scene was obviously then end part where all of the confessions came and then the epilogues where pretty good too!!! BB reid sure gave us a lot of epilogues for every character in the series and it was very entertaining to read!!<br><br><i><br>" Seriously, Ty-baby, you could make a nun feel shame,” Jamie teased.<br>“I knew you were a virgin, but damn, fainting?” <br>“Wha—what are you talking about?” I demanded, my voice hoarse for some reason. <br>“I fainted? Why?” <br>“You walked in on Wren raw-dogging Lou, that’s why.” <br>After glancing over his shoulder, he turned back to me and smirked. <br>“Judging by his scowl, I’m guessing it was before he blew his load.” <br>“Seriously, Jamie?” Lou screeched while sounding scandalized. "<br></i><br><br>The only thing which I disliked a Bit was that, Tyra was at times a bit manipulative . I mean I totally got where she was coming from , being cheated and all but using her chils as a means of revenge was fucked up. Now the Car cryshing part was totally deserved by vaughn. <br>The overall story was great and many scenes were funny and enjoyable , specially when jaime appereared :) . The prologue though made me cry huge ugly tears ,because that was fucking cold !!!<br>In my opinion this book is suitable for all mild dark romance lovers , who love their books with a complete asshole hero and a touch of pain and angst and a heroine who makes him pay for his fuckups!!<br><br><a href="https://imgur.com/8aKpn5A" rel="nofollow">
