Siobhan davis swooped in , and left me as a mess of tears and laughter by the end of this book!!</b><br><br>From the moment I read the Rydeville elite series by Siobhan Davis, I have been going crazy to read Jackson's story. The way he portrayed himself in the Rydeville series just made me so curios about his story. <br>And the author sure did not disappoint me. Jackson's story was absolutely perfect and then some! The way the author wrote the story was just amazing! both Vanessa and Jackson were perfect for reach other in more ways than one.<br>Both of them had their weaknesses and strength and fit each other completely. <br><br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1590143961i/29520839._SY540_.jpg" alt="jackson-collage-EDIT-1" class="gr-hostedUserImg extra_img"><br><br>There were parts in the book were I wanted to slap some sense into Jackson. He was an even bigger asshole than Kai in the Rydeville trilogy and that is saying something!!! if only he had talked to Vanessa about the matter, so much pain could have been avoided.<br>Then there was Vanessa. God!! she went through so much!! the horrors of her past were something, no one should experience! and then even after so much pain , she was such an honest an humble person. Her kindness and strength were something to aspire a lot of people out there who survived horrors like her. <br>We also got to meet the Kennedys in this book, and all of them played their part amazingly. I absolutely loved the scenes in which they made appearance!<br>I was so happy that in the end everything worked out for the best and the ending of this book was amazing. <br>Jackson is a ride filled with so much pain and suffering, but the author has done an amazing job of countering those feelings with the complete happy ending and those numerous happy scenes, that had tears forming in my eyes. One of my favorite parts of the book , were to see Jackson grovelling. Vanessa sure gave him a hard time and him, being so stubborn, didn't give up on her! his grovelling was something I was looking forward too, because he certainly took the gold medal of the most asshole guy the Siobhan's rydeville world!!!! <br>This book was one of my most anticipated story and I certainly enjoyed it a lot!!! It is recommended to all the bully romance lovers, with lots of pain and angst, with a complete major jackass hero and a heroine who makes him grovel for it!!<br><br><a href="https://imgur.com/8aKpn5A" rel="nofollow">
