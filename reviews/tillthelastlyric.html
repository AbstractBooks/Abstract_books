</a><br><i>“ All I ever wanted was for them to be proud of me and now look... I was everything they didn’t want. I’d become my own worst nightmare. “</i><br>“Till the last lyric “ is the 2nd book of Cash Mcgraw and Journey Peirce. We already met them in love hurts duet <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search/search?q=%20" rel="nofollow"> </a> and first saw them in the pierced hearts duet. This book was full of drama and angst and I absolutely loved it. I had been waiting for this book to release for god know how long and the wait was totally worth it. But still, man I am sooooooo sad that this series is over. <br><a href="https://imgur.com/lf4twVc" rel="nofollow">

</a><br>In the story we get to know more about Cash and how his life turned out after he left his home. After reading the love hurts duet , I sure had a lot of doubts about Cash’s character and why he took some decisions he did. Honestly speaking I never even expected him to get his own series. But at the end of the love hurts duet when I got to know that he was getting a duet was himself, am I was excited . <br>We all had a lot of questions regarding cash from the love hurts duet, and let me tell you , none of your questions will be left unanswered because M.Robinson has done a damn good job of clearing our doubts. I was totally satisfied with the explanations given in this book.<br>Every relationship in the book, let It be of cash and journey, cash and his father and also cash and Harley , has been such an emotional ride . mine favorite was of Dylan and cash.<br><br><i>“ And I know wit’ all my heart ... my father would say—”<br>“I’m so damn proud of you.” " </i><br> <br>I always thought why Dylan was so unsupportive of cash that he drew him to leave their house, but after reading these series I totally got his reasons. There was some scenes of cash and Dylan that literally had me blinking back tears. They both were so stubborn it was infuriating at times. We all remember Dylan from his young times, well it was like 2 Dylans arguing.<br><br> <a href="https://imgur.com/qepS2E3" rel="nofollow">

</a><br> <i>“ Repeating over and over, “I’m sorry.” <br>I was. <br>For so many things. <br>My mother. <br>My family. <br>Harley. <br>Bailey. <br>Now her. <br>My June. <br>Just like Johnny, I tore her down with me. <br>’Cuz at the end of the day...<br>This was all I had to give. “ </i><br><br><i>“ .Junie,” I whispered in a tone of pure agony. “Show me what love is.” “ </i><br><a href="https://imgur.com/gyc7AiE" rel="nofollow">

</a><br>The relationship of cash and journey was also really sweet. The string scenes of baby journey had me laughing and smiling so hard. God they were so cute!!!! Journey goes to meet cash and somehow convinces him to come home again , and from that point things go downhill. But they made of it alive and the ride was totally worth the pain and hurt. <br>I would recommend this to anyone loving a good drama filled ride with an asshole Rockstar and a sweet girl from his childhood. This book is totally worth the read.<br><br>such a GREAT job the author has done.<br><a href="https://imgur.com/bHw77Cz" rel="nofollow">
